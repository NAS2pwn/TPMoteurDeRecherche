   In a description of a Manhattan reading starring Harper's editor
 wsh Lewis Lapham wsh  and Paris Review editor  wsh George Plimpton wsh , the New

with a fat trust fund and a tweed jacket'' in deciding which of the
literary lions to hit up for work.

   At Harper's, says the Observer, Lapham lurks around ``in his
fancy-man suits;  wsh Colin Harrison wsh , hubby of dirty-book writer
 wsh Kathryn wsh 
 wsh Harrison wsh , (is there) to amuse you; you have to do quite a bit of
work; when you leave, they give you a mug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Review, on the other hand, has ``George Plimpton
riding his bicycle; better cheese at the parties; no work
whatsoever; when you leave they give you an editorial assistantship
at Vanity Fair.''

relationship:

<P>
   ``When I met my date, the first thing he commented on was how
great my hair looked. Then, all night long, he kept complimenting
me on how straight it was, how good it looked. ... I saw the $30
blowouts as an investment. I dated him for a few months, and the
whole time, he had no idea I have curly hair. I avoided showering
at his house, we never went swimming, and we didn't go to the gym
together _ so how would he know? I was a little anxious about what
would happen when the summer came, but luckily, we broke up before
then.''
